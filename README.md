# Project MVP: eat Seasonally app
Our app allows a user to select from a list of foods that are in season in a particular month, or select all foods that are in season for a particular season, and then search for recipes containing those foods. Ingredients for the selected recipes can be saved to a personal shopping list, helping users to eat more seasonal foods and consume in a more environmentally conscious way.
